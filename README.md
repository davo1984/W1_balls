# W1_balls

Just a little game in which the Red and Green circles can be moved to "eat" the balls. Red is controlled by ASDW and Green by the arrow keys. 

The purpose in writing this program was simply to gain experience with Objects and OOP concepts.

This code is straight JavaScript and should be able to be hosted almost anywhere. Locally if you have a web server running, as a public DropBox file or run it on GitHub. I hope you enjoy.

### NOTICE

Red only works correctly on the Chrome browser (Edge and any other Chromium based browser should work as well, although I have not tested them). I plan to fix at some future date, just to learn how to make keyCode work on both browser types.

##### There is always more to do.
